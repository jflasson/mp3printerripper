# mp3printerripper
Rips new songs added to the mp3printer

My first python program, so there is probably quite a lot of unintended features.

Files that are not in mp3 format will be changed to mp3.

## System requirements ##
Before you run ripper.py, make sure you have Python 3 running on your system.
Also run "pip install requests"
